I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, even though I had correctly imported and configured Tailwind in my project.  The classes would appear in the HTML, but wouldn't render the styles. Inspecting the element in the browser's developer tools showed that the classes were present, yet no styles were associated with them.
