This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where styles wouldn't be applied to elements despite the classes being correctly added. The bug manifests inconsistently, sometimes working as expected and sometimes failing.  The `bug.html` file shows the issue, while `bugSolution.html` provides a solution involving a careful review of Tailwind's configuration and purge options, ensuring all necessary classes are included and that there are no conflicting styles or selectors.
