The issue was resolved by carefully reviewing the Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js) and the purge options (content section).  It turned out that a specific component was not being correctly included in the purge process, leading to Tailwind removing its styles. By adding the specific component path to the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js`, Tailwind correctly processed the component's CSS.  It's also crucial to ensure that no conflicting CSS rules or selectors override the Tailwind classes.
